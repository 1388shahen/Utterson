# !! What is the earliest evidence of life on Earth?

==

Traditional date: 3.5 billion years ago. Based on real bacterial fossil evidence. 

Newer dates: 3.8/4.1 billion years ago. Based on indirect evidence. (Not long after origin of Solar System and Earth, already have life. Evolve very rapidly, that is why people debate that there used to be life on Mars.)


Conditions of early Earth to figure out existence. 

## I. Handean (First 500 My)
- Early Bombardment: triggered first seas 
- Planets show scars of being hit repeatedly by moon size chunks of space rock
- Early enviroment not a hostpital place for life to evolve
- However, bombardment may have triggered development of oceanic oceans.... which may have triggered origin of life. 

Hadean Atmosphere 
- Methane dominated (rather than Oxygen)
- Warm world, (even if Sun was much dimmer) because Metahne better greenhouse gas and retains energy more efficiently
- Necesary elements already present in oceans/atmosphere

Miller Experiment
- mixed representative conditions of early atmopshere/oceans...
- TA: amino acids (building blocks of protein, and thus life) and other organic molecules can be generated from exposure and time, based on conditions of early atmopshere 
- Self-replication means life 


Evidence from Extremophiles
- Early life can exist in extremely hazzadours conditions
- Bcteria that live in extremely high temperatures, high acidity, etc. so even if experiement skewed, evidence that bacteria can live in extremely hazzardous conditions

What conditions are minimally necessary for life to originate and thrive (minimun to reproduce)? 

(gene mutations)

DNA evidence -- all thiving things are related. For single apperance of life 

- Prokaryotes: most simple form of life today. 
    + asexual, small, DNA not well packaged
    + represent ancestral state of 99% of life 
- Eukaryotes 

(see slides)

...

Prokaryotes in the fossil record:
- First appear 3.5-3.8 billion years ago
- they are capable of doing photosyntehsis without a seperate structure in their bodies 

How can you see prokaryotes in fossil record?

**Stromatolies** 
- biomap of bacteria, stir up sediment looking for resources, put on top of themselves and drowns them up, move up a layer, and cycle repeats. End up with layers of sedminet with bacterial traces 



## II. Archean
- life does not mean complex life. For billions of years, simple life existed (i.e. if we find life in other plants, likely to be in similar stage)
    + multicelluarity is harder to achieve than colonies (lots of indivudals working in conjuction whereas multicelluarity is where cells act indivdually and cannot surive each other)

### Origin of Eukaryotes:
- Prokaryotes co-opted other prokaryotes. These symbiosis/parasites became organelles. 
- Mitrochrondira trapped in Eukaryote cells. Still asexual even though they are contained in sexual cells. 
- Chloroplast responsible for photosyntehsis 
(so plants have both)

Earliest - Algea 
- Grypania, 2.1 billion years ago. Found in Michigan 



Origins of Phytoplankton: 
- Indirect: change in atmosphere - Methane and CO2 replaced by nitrogen and oxygen (huge spike in oxygen levels)...... 
 - 1. first instance of global glaciation 
- Enabled other Eukaryotes life to evolve 
- 2. Banded Iron Formations 
    + 2.4-1.9 billion years ago. Oxygen pulses "rush" iron in the ocean
- Phytoplankton enabled rise of other Eukaryotes that don't have chloroplast.

Acritarchs 
- platonic forms which may be resting cysts of algae (or animals)


Once we have Eukaryotes, diversify into many forms:
- you have to be a Eukaryotes to have multicellularity but not all eukaryotes are multicellular 

### III. Cryogenian 
- Snowball earth at 720 and 650 million years ago. 
- So had multicellular life existed, this would have completely stopped it on its tracks. First mass extinction we know of in the record.



First multicellular life 
- coincides with last of (above) glacial pulses 
- Doushantuo formation - 620 million years ago 
- 1st evidence of multicellular life!!


Then split into a variety of lineages.. 
    - Plants, fungi, algae, Animals


### Ediacaran Fauna 
- 600-540 mya 
- first complex, multicellular life and ecosystems
- mostly immobile (but cells doing different jobs)
 

First complex ecosystems. 
- Large sizes and multicellularity 
- May have been triggered by new microscopic predators

# !! When did the first complex ecosystems evolve? -- Why doesn't everything use same resource -- Why Isn't earth covered in mass of similar bacteria









--- 
# !! When did modern phyla orginate?
