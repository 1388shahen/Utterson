title: Feeling thankful for Poole 
---

At first, I wanted to build this theme from scratch. I wanted to stay true to what Jekyll represents and not accumulate any unnecessary bloat. But, at the end, I decided to kick start development with [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), a vanilla Jekyll install built by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo), who coincidently is also the creator of Bootstrap. 

And I'm glad I did. Poole provided only the essentials of what any blog setup would need. I only had to remove two additions. Notably, I removed RSS feed    (does anyone still use that anymore?) and pagination (it's deprecated, it's a headache to deal with for newer versions). I replaced these features in favor of an email subscription and an archive page, respectively. 

Besides that, I reformatted post dates. Before they were in the home page and at the beginning of each post. When people see dates everywhere, they treat that number as an expiration date for when your post would have been useful. 
So I removed them from everywhere but the bottom of every page. Since good advice does not expire. (:

In terms of nomenclature, I'm a fan of Otto's *Dr. Jekyll and Hyde* naming scheme. I was delighted to see the character [Gabriel Utterson](http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/characters.html), who is the narrator and a loyal friend of Jekyll's, was not taken. 

All in all, thanks to Otto for the solid foundation. If you're considering designing your on Jekyll blog, be sure check out [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole). Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and download [Utterson](http://utterson.alidcastano.com/). (:
