title: Introducing Utterson, Jekyll's loyal companion
---

Utterson was build on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and  [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), a vanilla Jekyll install built by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). It was designed and developed [@alidcastano](https://twitter.com/alidcastano) to provide a minimal and unassuming theme, focused on what matters: you and your content.

Utterson provides a fully-functional setup, of what I believe to be fundamental to any blog, to get you up and writing, with minimal effort.

* **Home Page** - one that is focused on the owner and is easy to navigate.
* **Newsletter Subscription** - so that you can build your audience. 
* **Contact Form** - so you can be reached, without revealing any personal information. 

Also, building off Poole's vanilla install:

* **A holistic Jekyll setup** (layouts, config, [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), home page navigation, and posts.
* **Easily scalable** text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS.
* **Mobile Friendly Design** - so your site can be accessed on any device.

If you'd like to see the theme in action, you can see it live on my [site](alidcastano.com).

And, in case you're interested, these are three other themes, also built by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) on Poole: [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), [Enfield](http://enfield.getpoole.com). But, if I'm honest, you're best of picking this one. (;
