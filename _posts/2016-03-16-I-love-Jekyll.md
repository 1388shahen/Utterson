title: Why I love Jekyll
---

I used WordPress for two years. I never liked it. I just couldn't pick out why and everyone used it, so I stuck with it.

That is, until I discovered [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. 

Suddenly, I felt as if everything that was WordPress was staring at me in the face. It's bloated CMS, WYSIWYG editors, PHP plug-ins. Never again!


The Co-founder of Github, [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo), created Jekyll back in 2008 to do away with the complexity of other blogging platforms. He sought to create  work flow that would allow him to, as he put it, [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).


Now, it has become one of my favorite reasons for learning to how to code. One, so that I can call myself a hacker and, two, so that I can blog like one. 

And you can, too.

It was with a similar purpose that I created this theme for the both of us. To eliminate the unnecessary complexity of typical blog designs and create a minimal yet unique theme that focused on content and user experience, above all.

I hope you find it useful. Share your thoughts with me at [@alidcastano](https://twitter.com/alidcastano) or [contribute on GitHub](http://utterson.alidcastano.com/).
