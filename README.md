# Utterson

*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. This lawyer is Mr. Gabriel John Utterson, a loyal friend of Jekyll's (and, soon enough, a loyal friend of yours, as well).

Utterson is loyal companion for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It was designed and developed by [@alidcastano](https://twitter.com/alidcastano) to provide a minimal yet fully functional set up for personal sites, so that you up and writing with minimal effort. 


You can see Utterson in action with the [demo site](http://utterson.alidcastano.com/) and in [my personal blog](http://alidcastano.com/).
