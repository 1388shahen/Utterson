# Utterson

*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. This lawyer is Mr. Gabriel John Utterson, a loyal friend of Jekyll's and Hyde's (and, soon enough, a loyal friend of yours, as well).

Utterson is a loyal companion for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It was designed and developed [@alidcastano](https://twitter.com/alidcastano) to provide a minimal and unassuming theme and get you up and writing with minimal effort.
